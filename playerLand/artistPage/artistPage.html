                    Demon Days is the second studio album by British virtual band Gorillaz. 
                    It was first released on 11 May 2005 in Japan and on 23 May 2005 in the
                    United Kingdom by Parlophone and in the United States by Virgin Records.
                    Produced by the band, Danger Mouse, Jason Cox, and James Dring, the album
                    features contributions from De La Soul, Neneh Cherry, Martina Topley-Bird,
                    Roots Manuva, MF Doom, Ike Turner, Bootie Brown of the Pharcyde, 
                    Shaun Ryder, and Dennis Hopper. As with the band's eponymous 2001 debut, 
                    the release of Demon Days and its respective live performances were both 
                    accompanied by various multimedia, including interactive features on the
                    Gorillaz website, a total of four animated music videos, and animatics for 
                    select videos. Almost all visuals associated with the album were designed 
                    by Gorillaz co-creator Jamie Hewlett, under his design company Zombie Flesh 
                    Eaters.
